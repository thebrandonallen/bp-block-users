Allows BuddyPress administrators to block users indefinitely, or for a specified period of time.

== Description ==

>This plugin requires BuddyPress 2.5.0+.

Sometimes a user in your community needs a some time to cool off. In BuddyPress, spamming or deleting the user is a destructive action, leaving little to no trace that the user existed. BP Block Users allows a capable user (administrators only by default) to block a user from logging into the site. Users can be blocked for a specified period of time, or indefinitely, if administrators need more time to determine the best course of action.

A message will be shown on the login screen when a blocked user attempts, but ultimately fails, to login, informing them that their account has been blocked. During the block period, email notifications are suspended.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What happened to versions `0.2.0`, `0.3.0`, `0.4.0`, `0.5.0`, `0.6.0`, `0.7.0`, `0.8.0`, and `0.9.0`?**

You blinked, and you missed them.

In reality, the changes made in version `1.0.0` were drastic enough, that the version change needed to help convey the message. While BP Block Users won't be following [semver](http://semver.org/) just yet, the `1.0.0` release needed to be treated as such.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.2 =
* Release date: TBD
* Update compatability to WordPress 4.9.1
* Fix incorrect Block User link in WP admin bar.

* Release date: 2017-04-12

* **TLDR**

	* The plugin has been completely rewritten.

* **The Fuller House**

	This plugin was written as a quick solution to an immediate need. It was then released on the off-chance others might find it useful. Turns out, it had staying power. At the time of this release, there are about 195 more people using it than I expected.

	That brings us to version `1.0.0`. *All* functions from version `0.1.0` have been deprecated. The deprecated functions will still perform as they did in `0.1.0`, but they will throw a deprecation warning when using `WP_DEBUG`.

	If you were using the plugin as-is, with no custom functionality built on top, then you don't need to do anything further. If you were using any of the functions/filters/hooks from version `0.1.0` for custom functionality, please see the [Upgrading to 1.0.0](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/bp-block-users/wiki/Upgrading-to-1.0.0) wiki page.

	Despite these major changes, the plugin should work the same or better than before!

* **Minimum Requirements**

	* Bumped minimum required WordPress version to 4.3.0.
	* Bumped minimum required BuddyPress version to 2.4.0.

* **Enhancements**

	* BP Block Users is now loaded as a BuddyPress component.
	* The `Block User` terminology has been changed to `Block Member` on the front-end to be more consistent with BuddyPress terminology. Props joost-abrahams [[GH#4](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/bp-block-users/pull/4)].
	* Added a blocked users list table to `Users > All Users` admin screen.
	* Added WP-CLI commands. Enter `wp bp-block-users --help` in your terminal for usage details.

* **Future Updates**

	* The next major version will require PHP 5.3+.
	* Deprecated functions, filters, and actions will be removed in a future release. The target right now is version `1.3.0`. Upgrade any code you've written against version `0.1.0`.

= 0.1.0 =

* Release date: 2015-09-22
* Initial release.
